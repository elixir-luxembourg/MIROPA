Minimum Information for Record Of Processing Activities
--------------------------------------------------------

MIROPA is a reporting guideline for Record Of Processing Activities in biomedical research.

## Motivation


## Highlights and Considerations
TODO:

- schema is adapted to research in biomedical domain
- some attributes are not required by Art. 30
  - recording processors and controllers to each activity can be exhaustive (comment from Fred)
  - 

## Files

```
/schema/    - JSON schemas for each entity
/context/   - context files mapping types in the schema to existing onthologies
```
